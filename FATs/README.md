# Individual FATs
This directory is intended to house the FATs that each team intends to execute on Freya. Each file within this directory is organized to encompass multiple "tasks" executed sequentially.

Various task types are defined to cater to different purposes:

- **Manual Tasks:** These tasks prompt the user to either execute a command or provide a yes/no response, which is then converted into a True/False value.
- **Boolean Tasks:** These tasks execute one or more commands and yield a True/False outcome based on the success of the command execution.
- **String Tasks:** These tasks execute one or more commands and check if the expected string appears in the resulting string.
- **Int Tasks:** These tasks execute one or more commands and compare the resulting value against a predefined expected value or range of values.
- **Array Tasks:** These tasks execute one or more commands and compare the results against a predefined array.
